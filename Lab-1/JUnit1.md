## Introduction

# 🧪 What is JUnit?

**JUnit** is a **popular open-source testing framework** for the Java programming language. It is widely used for writing and running **automated unit tests**, which help ensure that individual parts of a program (called *units*) work as intended.

## ✅ What is JUnit Good For?

### 🔍 1. **Verifying Code Correctness**
JUnit allows developers to write tests that automatically check if methods return expected results. This reduces bugs and improves confidence in the code.

### 🔁 2. **Regression Testing**
As code evolves, tests ensure that existing functionality still works and that new changes don’t break old features.

### 🧹 3. **Cleaner, More Reliable Code**
Writing tests encourages better design and forces developers to think about edge cases and error handling.

### 🔧 4. **Fast Feedback for Developers**
You can run your JUnit tests quickly after each code change to make sure everything still works — perfect for **test-driven development (TDD)**.

### 🤝 5. **Supports Team Collaboration**
When working in teams, automated tests make sure that code changes by one person don’t accidentally break someone else’s work.

## 📦 JUnit Features

- Easy test creation with `@Test` annotations
- Built-in assertions (e.g., `assertEquals`, `assertThrows`)
- Lifecycle hooks like `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`
- Parameterized tests for testing multiple inputs
- Integrates with IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) and build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle)

## 🧠 TL;DR

> **JUnit helps you catch bugs early, write better Java code, and work more confidently as a developer.**
